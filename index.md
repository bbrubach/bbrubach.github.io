Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research is on algorithms and theory with applications in e-commerce, fairness in machine learning, mechanism design for social good, and bioinformatics. My co-advisors are Professor <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~srin/">Aravind Srinivasan</a> and Professor <a href="http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~mpop/">Mihai Pop</a>. My broad research interests are summarized below with more detailed information on my <a href="/research">research page</a>.

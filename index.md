Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/cs">Computer Science Department</a> at <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu">Wellesley College</a>. My research is on algorithms and theory with applications in e-commerce, fairness in machine learning, mechanism design for social good, and bioinformatics. I did my PhD candidate in computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park with co-advisors <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~srin/">Aravind Srinivasan</a> and <a href="http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~mpop/">Mihai Pop</a>. My broad research interests are summarized below with more detailed information on my <a href="/research">research page</a>.

     	<strong>Hello Wellesley students!</strong>
     </p>
     <p>
	If you have questions about a course I'm teaching or interest in a research project related to my research (or the broad area of algorithms), please feel free to email me anytime. It's never too early to start thinking about a potential future research project.

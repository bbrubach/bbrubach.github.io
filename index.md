Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/cs">Computer Science Department</a> at <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu">Wellesley College</a>. My research is on algorithms and theory with applications in e-commerce, fairness in machine learning, democratic systems, mechanism design for social good, and bioinformatics. I did my PhD in computer science at the University of Maryland, College Park with co-advisors <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~srin/">Aravind Srinivasan</a> and <a href="http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~mpop/">Mihai Pop</a>. My broad research interests are summarized below with more detailed information on my <a href="/research">research page</a>.

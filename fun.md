Here are some other ways I spend my time when not doing research or teaching.

<h3>Social events and community building</h3>

<p>
	I am a big believer in the benefits of building community. I am the president of a grad student organization in the University of Maryland Computer Science Department (CS GradCo, formerly ExecCo). For three years, I've organized a monthly board game night for grad students that draws 20-50+ attendees. I also like organizing lunches and reading groups to bring grad students together.

<h3>Board game design</h3>

<p>
	I like designing, developing, and playing board games as a hobby. None of my designs have been published (yet!) although one of my games has been signed by a publisher. I've been fortunate to play a very small role in some of my friends' published game designs, including the award-winning 2019 hit, <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan">Wingspan</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I am a mentor in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tabletop-mentorship-program/">Tabletop Mentorship Program</a> to support new board game designers. Soon, I plan to start blogging about board game design and the many lessons I've learned so far.

<h3>Filmmaking</h3>

I used to work in film and my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Bacon_number">Erdős-Bacon number</a> is 6 (by generous calculation), but my Erdős-Bacon-Sabbath number is infinite due to limited musical ability.

title: Advice for organizing grad student events
permalink: /eventadvice/
---


This page is a work-in-progress and summarizes what I've learned about how to organize a successful, recurring event for grad students. My experience is from the perspective of a computer science grad student. The most successful events I've organzed at UMD (and my favorite) have been board game nights, owing partly to my passion for board games and I'll give some specific game night tips at the end.


<h3>Universal advice - build relationships</h3>
It is easy to do everything through email communications, but much better to sometimes speak to people in person.

build relationships

You will get to know a lot of great people

The staff in college departments tend to be some of the nicest people around.


<h3>Booking a room</h3>

<p>
	Space is one of the most constrained resoureces on college campuses


</p>




<h3>Ordering food</h3>

<p>
	Any event overlapping a meal time should have food and free food can be a big draw to bring people together.

You can often negotiate with local businesses

<h3>Publicizing the event</h3>

<h3>Funding and reporting</h3>

<p>


Depending on your funding situation, you may need to collect the names of attendees. A simple sign-in sheet can be a pain because people are generally incapable of following the instruction, "Please print neatly."
Collect names of attendees in your RSVP form and keep a list of all
</p>




<h3>Delegating</h3>

<p>

One person handles bringing the drinks.

This takes some of the load off of you and prevents burn-out.

Others get to know the process of running the event. They can then take over organizing the event one night if you can't make it due to a paper deadline or life stuff happening. 

There are people who can take over organizing when you graduate.

<h3>Board game nights</h3>

<p>
	A good department library favors lighter more approachable games. Players who enjoy heavier strategy games often own and bring these games themselves.

Suggested titles for a small department game library:
<ul>
	<li>The Resistance: Avalon</li>
	<li>Carcassonne</li>
	<li>Hanabi</li>
	<li>Pandemic</li>
	<li>Ticket to Ride</li>
</ul>

Additional suggestions for a growing game library:
<ul>
	<li>Coup</li>
	<li>Dominion</li>

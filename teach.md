<h3>Teaching at Wellesley</h3>

<p>
I'm excited to be teaching my first courses at Wellesley College this fall.
</p>

<p>
CS 115 Computing for the Socio-Techno Web (term 1) <br>
CS 231 Fundamental Algorithms (term 2) 
</p>

<h3>Guest lectures in summer camps</h3>

<p>
I have taught guest lectures in two different summer camps run by the Maryland Center for Women in Computing (MCWIC). These camps aim to increase diversity in CS by promoting early involvement. I taught sixth graders in the Computer Science Connect (CompSciConnect) camp about map coloring and NP-completeness. I taught high schoolers in the Introduction to Computing 101 camp about fairness, accountability, and transparency in machine learning (FATML). Teaching CS topics to these age groups is tons of fun and I recommend it.

<p>
Anyone interested in reproducing my map coloring and NP-completeness lecture for middle schoolers (or even older students) is welcome to use my materials and contact me with any questions.

Materials: <a href="/files/ColoringIsHard-9-24-19.pdf">Slides</a> and <a href="/files/ColoringHandout.pdf">Handout</a>. If you use these, I'd love to hear about it.

<h3>CMSC 122 Intro to programming via the web (Spring 2019)</h3>

<p>
I taught a course for non-majors that introduced basic programming concepts through web development. Many of the students were math or journalism majors due to the course fulfilling requirements for those majors. Being my first time independently teaching a course, this was a big learning experience for me and reinforced my desire to teach in addition to doing research.

<h3>Teaching assistantship at the University of Maryland</h3>

<p>
I have served as a teaching assistant (TA) for several courses at the University of Maryland, College Park ranging from introduction to programing through a 400-level algorithms course. For a large programming course (700+ students), I served as lead TA, managing and mentoring the other teaching assistants. During another semester, I helped with an effort to redesign the course, including developing projects and providing a guest lecture.
</p>
<p>
I am currently a teaching assistant for <a href="https://cmsc320.github.io/">Introduction to Data Science</a>.

<h3>Teaching artist work</h3>

Prior to studying computer science, I worked as a teaching artist in Chicago Public Schools through Columbia College Chicago's Center for Community Arts Partnerships (CCAP), a recipient of the <a href="https://nasaa-arts.org/nasaa_research/national-arts-humanities-youth-program-awards/">National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award</a>. During the school day, I partnered with classroom teachers to develop and present arts-integration lessons over several weeks that merged filmmaking with traditional subjects such as math and writing. The lessons were still required to meet state and federal education standards for the traditional subjects. In the afterschool setting, I led afterschool classes on filmmaking that spanned the entire school year. I got the opportunity to work with a broad range of students from 3rd to 8th grade, including working in a special education classroom. I have lots of fun stories about the crazy ideas the kids came up with.
